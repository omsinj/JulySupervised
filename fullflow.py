# MACHINE LEARNING WORKFLOW EXPLAINED (For Beginners)

## 🎯 Problem Statement
We want to predict the **loan amount** a person is eligible for, based on details like their income, credit history, education, and other features. This is a **regression problem** — where the output is a **continuous numerical value**.

---

## 📂 Step 1: Load the Data
```python
import pandas as pd
dataset = pd.read_csv('Loan.csv')
```
- Use `pandas` to load the dataset from a CSV file.
- The dataset contains borrower information and loan details.

---

## 🔍 Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand the dataset:
```python
dataset.info(), dataset.describe(), dataset.columns
```
- Visualize relationships:
```python
sns.pairplot(), sns.boxplot(), plt.scatter()
```

**Why this matters:**
- Understand distributions, relationships, and detect potential issues like **missing values** and **outliers**.

---

## 🧹 Step 3: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

### 🔧 Handle Missing Values
```python
dataset['LoanAmount'].fillna(dataset['LoanAmount'].median(), inplace=True)
```
- **Median** for numeric fields (robust to outliers)
- **Mode** for categorical fields (most frequent value)

### 🔠 Encode Categorical Variables
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
```
- Convert categorical columns (like 'Gender', 'Property_Area') into numbers for ML algorithms.

### 📊 Feature Selection
- Define features (`X`) and target (`y`):
```python
X = dataset[features]
y = dataset['LoanAmount']
```

---

## 🚫 Step 4: Outlier Detection & Removal
- Use **Z-score** to detect and remove extreme values:
```python
from scipy.stats import zscore
zscore(dataset['LoanAmount'])
```
- Drop rows where Z-score > threshold (e.g. 2.9)

**Why this matters:**
Outliers can distort your model’s predictions and lead to inaccurate results.

---

## 📏 Step 5: Feature Scaling
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```
- Normalize features so all have mean=0 and std=1
- Important for models like Linear and Polynomial Regression

---

## 🧪 Step 6: Split the Data
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
```
- Keep some data for **testing** model performance
- Avoid evaluating on the same data you train on (prevents overfitting)

---

## 🤖 Step 7: Model Training

### ✅ Linear Regression
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
- Simple, interpretable model that fits a straight line to data

### ✅ Decision Tree Regressor
```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
model = DecisionTreeRegressor()
```
- Non-linear model, captures complex patterns

### ✅ Polynomial Regression
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=3)
```
- Expands features to higher degrees
- Captures non-linear relationships

## 📈 Step 8: Model Evaluation

### 🔍 Evaluation Metrics (Regression)
| Metric         | Description                                               | Good For           |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **MSE**        | Mean Squared Error – penalizes large errors               | General performance|
| **RMSE**       | Root Mean Squared Error – easier to interpret             | Popular baseline   |
| **MAE**        | Mean Absolute Error – less sensitive to outliers         | Simple errors      |
| **R² Score**   | How much variance is explained by the model              | Overall fit        |

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score, mean_absolute_error
print(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
print(r2_score(y_test, y_pred))
```

### 🔍 Visual Evaluation
```python
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred)
```
- Plot actual vs predicted values
- Ideal line: 45-degree line (perfect prediction)

## 🔁 Step 9: Model Improvement

### Strategies Tried:
✅ Added more features (e.g. ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome)  
✅ Removed outliers  
✅ Scaled features  
✅ Switched models (Linear → Decision Tree → Polynomial)

### General Tips:
- **Feature Engineering**: Create better input features
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust model settings (e.g. tree depth)
- **Cross-validation**: Use multiple train/test splits for robust performance
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine predictions from multiple models
